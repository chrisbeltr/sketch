                <main>
                    <p>
                        html has a lot of things that i've never touched of even
                        heard of so i wanna play with some of those
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i will absolutely <b>not</b> be doing the same thing
                        with css or js, those are entirely different beasts and
                        there's a <b>lot</b> that i've yet to explore or will
                        ever explore
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i'm having a lot of fun using depricated stuff, like
                        <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/marquee"
                            >marquees</a
                        >
                        and
                        <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/font"
                            >font tags</a
                        >
                        and
                        <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/center"
                            >center tags</a
                        >, and i had like <em>no</em> idea these things existed
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        we're also using some depricated attributes up in here,
                        like the attributes in the body element
                    </p>
                    <details>
                        <summary>huh, never seen this tag before</summary>
                        very interesting <pre></pre> tag we have here! doesn't even need any
                        javascript to funtion, very handy<br />could use some
                        styling however...
                    </details>
                    <plaintext>
now, for my final (unintended) magic trick,
this is the <plaintext></plaintext> element!
in here, <em>anything</em> i type will just be
<b>plain text.</b> absolutely no formatting here!
(the formatting from the font element outside still applies though)
the line breaks in this paragraph are actual line breaks
in the editor, not <br> tags (those don't work, remember?)
i also don't think the text in here will wrap,
it just extends off the screen. weird stuff!
weirdest of all though, i think you'll notice
there's some visible tags after this paragraph!
that was not at all intended by me, but i guess
a little quirk of this plaintext tag is that even
its closing tag is treated as plaintext...
so the plaintext never actually stops. pretty silly.
that means the rest of this page is different
depending who's looking at it, for me there's a bunch
of javascript code that some of my extensions inject
into the page. i'd link an image here to show you but
i just realized it... wouldn't work because of the plaintext tag.
sigh... guess we really should just stick to the <pre>pre</pre> tag
                    </plaintext>
                </main>
            </center>
        </body>
