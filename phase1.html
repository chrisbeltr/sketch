            html has a lot of things that i've never touched of even heard of so
            i wanna play with some of those
          </p>
          <p>
            i will absolutely <b>not</b> be doing the same thing with css or js,
            those are entirely different beasts and there's a <b>lot</b> that
            i've yet to explore or will ever explore
          </p>
          <p>i'm having a lot of fun using depricated stuff:</p>

            very interesting tag we have here! doesn't even need any javascript
            to funtion, very handy<br />could use some styling however... too
            bad it doesn't have any useful attributes :/

          <plaintext>
now, for my final (unintended) magic trick,
this is the <plaintext></plaintext> element!
they're similar to the <xmp></xmp> tags but
they're also depricated, so they shouldn't be used.
sincy this is depricated, it might work differently
on other browsers, so i can't guarantee it does
what i want it to but... that's the fun of
using depricated things i suppose :3 i'm testing
this on chrome so let me know how it does elsewhere!
in here, <em>anything</em> i type will just be
<b>plain text.</b> absolutely no formatting here!
(the formatting from the font element outside still applies though)
the line breaks in this paragraph are actual line breaks
in the editor, not <br> tags (those don't work :p)
i also don't think the text in here will wrap,
it just extends off the screen. weird stuff!
weirdest of all though, i think you'll notice
there's some visible tags after this paragraph!
that was not at all intended by me, but i guess
a little quirk of this plaintext tag is that even
its closing tag is treated as plaintext...
so the plaintext never actually stops. pretty silly.
that means the rest of this page is different
depending who's looking at it, for me there's a bunch
of javascript code that my live dev server injects
into the page. i'd link an image here to show you but
i just realized it... wouldn't work because of the plaintext tag.
sigh... guess we really should just stick to the
<pre></pre> and <code></code> tags, though with
those we still need to manually escape typical
xml syntax with &lt; and &gt; :/
